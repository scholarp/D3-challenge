          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>There is a fairly clear positive linear relationship between poverty and lacking healthcare. This means that 
            when the number of impoverished people increases, there is greater likelihood that the the percentage of the 
            population that lacks healthcare will increases.</p>

          <p>It appears that the majority of states with the lowest poverty and lowest rate of those that lact healthcare are
            states on the East Coast, while states the highest levels of both variables are in the Southern United States.</p>

          <p>Out of all 51 states (including Washington, DC), the average poverty rate is approximately 14.9%, and the 
            and the average lacks healthcare rate is approximately 12.6%. The Standard Deviation of the Population being 4.05 
            for Poverty and 0.6 for Healthcare.</p>
